# Classes in python
# we use classes to use new types to model real concepts 
# to define we use class + class_name and perform methods inside it
# use uppercase (P for point) called as pascal naming convention for class and rest variables or function use lowercase
class Point:
    # block -> fucntions or methods that belong to point
    def move(self):    # move is a func    # method 1 
        print("move")
    def draw(self):   # draw is a func     # method 1
        print("draw")


# now we create object with thse 2 point class methods
# Object is a instance of a class
# A class defined a blueprint for creating objects
