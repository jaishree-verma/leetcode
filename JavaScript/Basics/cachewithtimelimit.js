// Example 
// Input: 
// actions = ["TimeLimitedCache", "set", "get", "count", "get"]
// values = [[], [1, 42, 100], [1], [], [1]]
// timeDelays = [0, 0, 50, 50, 150]
// Output: [null, false, 42, 1, -1]
// Explanation:
// At t=0, the cache is constructed.
// At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 100ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.
// At t=50, key=1 is requested and the value of 42 is returned.
// At t=50, count() is called and there is one active key in the cache.
// At t=100, key=1 expires.
// At t=150, get(1) is called but -1 is returned because the cache is empty.

// Example 
// Input: 
// actions = ["TimeLimitedCache", "set", "set", "get", "get", "get", "count"]
// values = [[], [1, 42, 50], [1, 50, 100], [1], [1], [1], []]
// timeDelays = [0, 0, 40, 50, 120, 200, 250]
// Output: [null, false, true, 50, 50, -1, 0]
// Explanation:
// At t=0, the cache is constructed.
// At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 50ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.
// At t=40, a key-value pair (1: 50) is added with a time limit of 100ms. A non-expired value already existed so true is returned and the old value was overwritten.
// At t=50, get(1) is called which returned 50.
// At t=120, get(1) is called which returned 50.
// At t=140, key=1 expires.
// At t=200, get(1) is called but the cache is empty so -1 is returned.
// At t=250, count() returns 0 because the cache is empty.
